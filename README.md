## FreeCodeCamp React Project - Camper Leaderboard

## User Stories
- [ ] I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
- [ ] I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
- [ ] I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

## Thoughts
This was the first react-redux project where I used TDD heavily for actions and reducers. Actually that was the reason why I ditched create-react-app - I just couldn't make test libs install properly.

As for the project itself, the main idea was to add a sticky header and to use the same fancy scrollbar I used in the previous project.

## Additional Information
All data is received from a third-party Heroku app, what it means is that the data may not be displayed if something happens with the mentioned app. Other than that Camper Leaderboard is completely functional.
